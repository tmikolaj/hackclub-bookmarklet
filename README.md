# Dark mode bookmarklet for Hack Club's Hacklet
_Sample website included to showcase it_

## 🛠️ What does it do?

It enables the custom dark mode

If a site has a bright white background and a black text it is hard to read and tiring for the eyes. This is when the bookmarklet is helpful.
- Changes the background color to dark gray
- Changes the text color to a soft light gray

This change creates a smoother, low contrast reading experience

## 🌐 Sample website

The bookmarklet can be tested on a provided sample website in this repo or on the [hacklet's website](http://hacklet.hackclub.com/index.html).
